            <!-- About me -->
            <h2 id="about">About me and my goal for Altschool.</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate of metallurgical and materials engineering from Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). I currently work as a creative designer/project supervisor for an interior design firm in Lagos, Nigeria. It is intriguing how technology has evolved the modern world and programming has become applicable to our daily activities in all aspect of life and work.</p>
            <p>During my time in school, I became exposed to programming from a compulsory course in my early levels. After a long time away from basic programming, I got interested in knowing more about how our web works and most especially the cloud technology as it has become predominant in recent years and is frequent in making our everyday life easy from online streams to backing up data and so much more and that has made me interested in changing my career path to software engineering</p>
            <p>I knew about altschool from my sister and after following up for more information, I discovered about the cloud engineering course and i enrolled for it. Altschool being an online education platform will make it easy for me to shuffle between work and learning easily, also interact with various tutors and students across the world, therefore i am pleased to be on this ride with altschool. My goal for altschool is to be fully equipped with the best knowledge, certifications and skills to set me on the next path of my journey to becoming a world class cloud engineer.</p>
